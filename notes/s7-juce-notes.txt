S7 juce notes
- got basic ui with a button and listener working
- trying to figure out what 

- so really I want a class for the engine that can act as an event
  listener, and can also have a reference to the main component to 
  make things happen
- is it ok for engine class to be Juce dependent??
  I guess so??

- we know:
  - there ought to be a class for the engine that gets
    instantiated in the main component

- left off, I think I have the way the components reference
  each other kinda borked
- stuck on the circular pointer stuff
